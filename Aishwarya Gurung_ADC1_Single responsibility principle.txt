In programming, the Single Responsibility Principle states that every module or class should have
responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.

One benefit of Single Responsibility Principle is that it makes your software easier to implement and prev
ents unexpected side-effects of future changes.


Example:

class User
{
    void CreatePost(Database db, string postMessage)
    {
        try
        {
            db.Add(postMessage);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            db.LogError("An error occured: ", ex.ToString());
            File.WriteAllText("\LocalErrors.txt", ex.ToString());
        }
    }
}
